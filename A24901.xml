            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Waldenſes</hi> being weary of living out of their own Country, have once again contriv'd the means of returning thither.</p>
            <p>This Affair was manag'd with ſo much precaution and ſecrecy, that the laudable <hi>Cantons</hi> were wholly ſtrangers to this Deſign. And all things being made ready for the execution, every Individual receiv'd Order to Repair on the <hi>Friday</hi>-Morning to the Wood of <hi>Nion,</hi> which is upon the Banks of the Lake, between this City and that of <hi>Geneva:</hi> And all obey'd the Orders: They had each a Musket, a Sabre, a Bayonett, and a Piſtol; this was all their Baggage: Being come to the Rendevouz, to the number of Two Thouſand Five Hundred <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and Five Hundred <hi>French</hi> Refugees, they were diſtributed into Companies, each of Twenty Five Men, to which were appointed a Captain, a Lieutenant, and Two Serjeants, all Men of Service. Some Days before they had made choice of an Officer of great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to Command them; they Swore to obey him, and the other Officers, after which was given to each a Pound of Powder, Lead in proportion, and Bread for Three Days.</p>
            <p>That ſame Day between Eight and Nine a Clock in the Evening, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being very cloſe and duskiſh, the Army march'd out of the Wood, and went to the Lake, where Twelve Veſſels waited to waft it over into <hi>Savoy.</hi> Before they went on Board, <hi>Meſſieurs Arnaud,</hi> and <hi>Boutrous, Waldenſian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who have never forſaken this People, and who have manag'd and brought this matter to the point it is, caus'd the Army to be drawn up in Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30900:2"/>and having all proſtrated themſelves on the Earth, Monſieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> made a long and fervent Prayer, which drew Tears from all thoſe of the Aſſembly: He compared them to to the <hi>People of Iſrael,</hi> upon the Shoar of the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> promiſing himſelf from the Goodneſs of GOD, that would bleſs their Enterprize, ſince it only tended to his Glory, to the Deliverance of their Miniſters, and of their Children that were unjuſtly detain'd in <hi>Savoy;</hi> and to return unto the Inheritance of their Fore-fathers, that ſo they might Serve GOD in Peace. The Prayer being ended, and the Reſolution taken not to do any injury to the Catholicks, at leaſt, unleſs they oppos'd their Paſſage, they Embark'd about a Thouſand Men, which was all the Twelve Veſſels could contain. When theſe had perform'd their paſſage, which was done in an Hour and halfs time, they return'd to take on Board as many more again; and this was done three times. The Maſters of the Veſſels who carried them over, report, That they met with none to oppoſe their Landing; but that in the Morning of the 27th, the Peaſants inhabiting about the Lake Toll'd an Allarum Bell, to warn their Neighbours to come in to their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> ſent to tell them, That they came not to do them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injury, that they only mean'd to paſs on; and that if they took any thing of the Inhabitants of the Country, they would faithfully pay for it. This was ſaid in ſuch manner, as that the <hi>Savoyards</hi> gave credit to it, and caus'd the Allarum-Bell to ceaſe. Our Brethren began their March in Battle-array, having a Van guard, and a Rear. It is beyond all expreſſion how much Joy and Reſolution they expreſs'd at their departure. If it has pleas'd the Lord to continue them his Aſſiſtance, they are by this time, believ'd to be got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Country: And if they are there, it is certain that all the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Forces will not be capable of driving them thence. I know not how his Royal Highneſs may have entertain'd this News; but do not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it will be very grating to, and diſreliſh'd by the Court of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Day before the departure of thoſe poor People, there was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, throughout the whole State, a Day of Faſting and Prayer, with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Juſt now we underſtand, that there is forming another Aſſembly of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> that remain'd in this Country, and that as ſoon as the Number ſhall be compleat, it is ſaid, they will follow the reſt; unleſs they are hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Cantons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> If theſe poor People ſucceed in their Deſign, it may poſſibly give occaſion to an Inſurrection of all the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants in <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock,</hi> and thus make way for as great Revolutions in <hi>France,</hi> as have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened elſe-where.</p>
